# Tips to get started
# Needed to save the file locally first.  Wouldn't run from Teams.
# Copy code below into a VBA Module in the workbook you want to save the sheets.  Then run manually.

# Code
Sub CreateNewWBS()
Dim wbThis As Workbook
Dim wbNew As Workbook
Dim ws As Worksheet
Dim strFilename As String

    Set wbThis = ThisWorkbook
    For Each ws In wbThis.Worksheets
        strFilename = wbThis.Path & "/" & ws.Name
        ws.Copy
        Set wbNew = ActiveWorkbook
        wbNew.SaveAs strFilename
        wbNew.Close
    Next ws
End Sub
